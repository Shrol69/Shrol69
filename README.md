👋 Hi, I’m @Shrol69!
👀 I’m interested in coding, learning new technologies, and exploring different programming languages.

🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and diving deeper into data science concepts.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python-based projects and connect with like-minded individuals.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me at gaykarayush588@gmail.com.

😄 Pronouns: He/him.

⚡ Fun fact: Besides coding, I also have a passion for drawing and animation!
